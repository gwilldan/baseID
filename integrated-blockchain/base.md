# Base

Centralized exchange (CEX) Coinbase unveiled their very own Ethereum Layer 2 chain named Base. Built on the OP Stack by Optimism, Base is an Optimistic rollup, as part of Optimism’s Superchain, to onboard Coinbase’s 100 million users to the on-chain world and other non-users. This was a logical step forward for Coinbase, with the recent collapse of FTX and the increasingly apparent need for decentralization away from centralized entities. More info on base can be gotten from their docs

Base is a promising ecosystem with growing adoption, and BaseID's main goal is to solve complexity in interaction with cryptographic addresses on places of widening adoption. Base provides an enabling environment, and we intend to start solving and growing on base.
