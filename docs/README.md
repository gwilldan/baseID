# ðŸ’¡ Introduction

Blockchain networks are built on the foundation of cryptographic addresses. While these addresses are essential for ensuring security and privacy, they present a significant hurdle for mainstream adoption. Cryptographic addresses, often comprising long strings of characters are not only difficult to remember but also prone to errors during manual entry. As the adoption of blockchain networks continue to grow, with Base Ecosystem leading the trail, simplifying these complex interactions between users and cryptographic addresses have become a necessity. Hence, the need for Base Identities (ID).

BaseID is a revolutionary decentralized naming system built on highly scalable Layers of the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a seamless and secure way to associate human-readable names with complex Ethereum addresses and content hashes. With BaseIDs, you can create, manage, and resolve names in a secure and immutable manner, also, allow decentralized Applications read and access associated names for enhanced user experience.&#x20;

This comprehensive guide is designed to provide you with all the information you need to understand, implement, and utilize BaseID effectively. Whether you're a developer, a blockchain enthusiast, or someone interested in decentralized systems, this documentation will serve as your go-to resource.

### Why use BaseID

* **Simplicity**: BaseID simplifies the process of sending cryptocurrencies, interacting with decentralized applications, and accessing content on this highly scalable layer of the Ethereum blockchain (Base), by using easy-to-remember names.
* **Decentralization**: BaseID operates on a decentralized blockchain, ensuring that no single entity has control over the naming system. This eliminates the risk of censorship and enhances user autonomy.
* **Security**: Names and mappings are secured through blockchain's cryptographic mechanisms, reducing the risk of spoofing, unauthorized changes and address phishing.
* **Interoperability**: BaseID has underlaying products; D-Mail (a decentralised mailing system where resolved IDs can send and recieve encrypted messages) and B-Socials (a social network for resolved IDs). These products can be integrated into different decentralized applications.
* **User Control**: Users retain ownership of their names and can update or transfer them without relying on intermediaries or time periods.
* **Non-Renewable:** In the bid to give users total control of their Identity ownership, every registered ID has no expiration time, and hence, no need for renewal of any sort.
