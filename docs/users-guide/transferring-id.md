# ðŸ“¤ Transferring ID

IDs are represented as ERC721 tokens, also known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), this a type of digital asset standard on the Ethereum blockchain, introduced as a way to represent ownership of unique items or digital assets in a decentralized and secure manner. One of the key features of an ERC721 token is Ownership and Transfer, these features are carefully embedded in each ID.

In addition, every ID has a storage capacity which can take in an Infinite length of string data which becomes immutable on storage. This can be used to preserve anything and can be retrieved anytime on demand by the owner. On safe transfer of ID, either by secondary purchase or direct wallet-to-wallet transfer, the new owner inherits the data.&#x20;
