# ðŸ›  DApp Integration

Provisions are made for other Decentralized Applications to harness BaseIDs Key functionalities and fully incorporate on their Application. These Applications would be able to fetch data through our API which would give relevant access to IDs and mapped addresses, for a better user experience.

One of the most fascinating use-case would be to have ".base" Identities replacing complex cryptographic addresses on all DApps on Base Ecosystem.
