# ðŸ’¼ Utilizing ID

### Tokenized ID Ownership

BaseID is a decentralized system that maps human-readable names to complex blockchain addresses on the Base network. This decentralization empowers users to have full control over their digital identities, free from central intermediaries and the risk of censorship. Each ID is represented by an ERC721 standard token with metadata being a hashed value from the ID string.

Tokenized ownership introduces a new layer of utility to BaseID. By tokenizing ownership, users can transform their naming rights into valuable digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded on marketplaces. However, our priorities for each ID go way pass being solely for trading, as we have a burning zeal to remove complexity in user's daily interaction with complex cryptographic addresses, especially in a new blockchain ecosystem, where adoption is considerably high.

### D-Mail

Mails have long been the backbone of digital communication. But as centralized email services gained prominence, concerns regarding data privacy, security breaches, and censorship have escalated. These challenges called for a paradigm shift in the way we envision mail communication. Hence, a power tool - Decentralized Mail.

The fusion of decentralized mail and IDs creates a solid background for secure and seamless communication. Each user with an ID can send and recieve encrypted mails with D-Mail. This simplifies the mail addressing process and enhances user-friendliness.

The cryptographic nature of each ID ensures end-to-end encryption for emails, safeguarding the content from unauthorized access and surveillance. Imagine an mailing system not controlled by a single entity, resistant to censorship, and places data privacy in the hands of users. This is precisely what Decentralized Mail and IDs strives to achieve.

### B-Socials

With all complex addresses being represented with simpler IDs, BaseID presents a network to build and strengthen community bonds. Building a social network on the ID framework would redefine user experience by combining the features of traditional social media with the benefits of a newly found decentralized technology - Base.

### ID Staking and Voting

One of the core values of BaseID is user control. Also, DeFi governance empowers participants to collectively make crucial decisions about protocol upgrades, parameter adjustments, and resource allocation. Voting enables token holders to express their preferences, ensuring that the DeFi ecosystem remains dynamic, responsive, and adaptable.

The integration of IDs into DeFi voting brings user-centricity and accessibility to the governance process. By combining the power of decentralized naming with the fundamentals of staking and voting, IDs enhance participation and fosters a more inclusive decision-making environment.

IDs provide a clear and auditable record of participation involved in voting. BaseID aims to achieve that.

### D-App Integration

Interoperability is one of the Key features of BaseID. Integration process for IDs to other DApps would be done swiftly, this allows Decentralized Applications easy access to query and link IDs to respective wallets interacting on them.

Most of this utility products have been built and tested, awaiting implementation. We, however, may not release all utilities entirely. Building on a relatively new ecosystem, we have need to ensure certain things are inplace before implementation. Nonetheless, We remain committed to making sure that BaseID solves the plaguing issues, and would be glad to work with any team to achieving this common goal.
